Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of the Internet!

### About Me (the TL;DR version)
I'm a mission- and vision-driven software developer with over 10 years of hands-on research & development.
I hold an MASc and PhD from the University of Toronto, where I worked, conducted research, and taught for the better part of 10 years.
My academic work and research focused on software-based control and management of cloud infrastructures (more info on the [research page](/research.html)).

Quick qualifications snapshot:
- Software Development: Proficient in C/C++, Python, Golang, Bash/Shell; Past projects and experience using CUDA C, JavaScript & Node.js, Java;
- Managed operations of Linux-based clusters and network administration; physical planning and setup of IT infrastructure; developing and deploying networked applications & services; working with open source projects (at the University of Toronto);
- Designed & implemented custom avionics software stack for space vehicles (at SpaceRyde).

3 random tidbits:
1. I love science fiction, discussing about TV shows & movies, and eating all types of noodles.
2. Currently trying to learn French and how to do a handstand. Currently failing at the latter. ðŸ˜”
3. I think the education system needs to teach students how to *properly* use Google.

### Motivation
I find motivation in work that puts people first, where I can see the effects of my efforts on people.
As a people-person, I like being able to interact with the users of my products or services, as I believe their feedback (good or bad) is always the best gauge of whether I've done my job right.
This is the reason why I enjoy teaching as a side-gig; being able to see my efforts pay off in students as they grasp new concepts, gain confidence, and apply their skills to solve new problems.

What sets me apart is my ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to complex problems.
I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and applying them to real-world problems.
I'm excited about opportunities where I can apply my skills and experiences toward new challenge and make a real impact on people's lives.
