Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of the Internet!

### About Me (the TL;DR version)
I'm currently finishing up my PhD at the University of Toronto, where I've been doing work, research, and teaching for the better part of 10 years.
My work and research focuses on software-based control and management of cloud infrastructures (more on this on the [research page](/research.html)).

3 random tidbits:
1. I love science fiction, discussing about TV shows & movies, and eating all types of noodles.
2. Currently trying to learn French and how to do a handstand. Currently failing at the latter. ðŸ˜”
3. I think the education system needs to teach students how to *properly* use Google.

### Motivation
I find motivation in work that puts people first, where I can see the effects of my efforts on people.
I like being able to interact with the users of my products or services, as I believe their feedback (good or bad) is always the best gauge of whether I've done my job right.
This is the reason why I enjoy teaching as a side-gig; being able to see my efforts pay off in students as they grasp new concepts, gain confidence, and apply their skills to solve new problems.

I hope to find work that can put me in similar positions where I can interact with people and help make life just a tad bit easier for them.
