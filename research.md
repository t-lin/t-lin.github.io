My academic background focused on ***applied research*** relating to software-based control and management of multi-tenant & multi-region cloud infrastructures.
As the primary sysadmin of a [multi-university cloud testbed](https://savinetwork.ca/) for close to 10 years, my work enabled my own research as well as others' research.

I've had the opportunity to work on everything from the underlying hardware compute infrastructure, to wired and wireless networks, and to setting up and configuring IaaS and PaaS software.
This mix of hands-on experience across different layers and tiers allows me to understand what pieces of tech will work best together to enable a given function, service, or application.

My list of publications can be [found on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=amjVEbEAAAAJ&hl=en) and generally encompasses 5 areas:
* Infrastructure and Service Monitoring
* Cloud Auto-Scaling
* SDN-Enabled Service Chaining and Network Function Virtualization
* SDN-Enforced Quality of Service
* P2P Service Meshes

I've also spent 3 years helping to design and develop evaluation tools for a quality-of-experience (QoE) project that evaluated people's subjective opinions of a video network service.
This project provided much insight for how I now approach teaching, with me being the "service" (more on this over on the [teaching page](/teaching.html)).
It's also given me new ideas about how user-facing services and applications should be designed, as well as changed how I approach my role as a sysadmin.
