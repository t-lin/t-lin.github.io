I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto. My research focuses on software-based control and management of multi-tenant & multi-region cloud infrastructures, and I've touched a bit on everything from wired and wireless networks, to software, to the underlying hardware. I'm basically a glorified IT guy.

My list of publications can be [found on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=amjVEbEAAAAJ&hl=en).
