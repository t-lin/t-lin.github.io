My definition of teaching is: ***the art of dumbing shit down***.  
I aim, to the best of my ability, to explain concepts in ways a layman can comprehend.
This typically involves the use of ***imagery and carefully selected analogies*** as the first stepping stone into any new subject.
I also favour the use of ***demos to tie the abstract concepts learned in class to the real-world***.

I've been a teaching assistant for 10 years, serving multiple courses in roles ranging from leading tutorials, to lecturing, to designing and running hands-on labs.
I've also helped to re-design old courses and develop new ones as well.
I'm a firm believer that ***hands-on experience is required*** to truly learn any new technology or skill.

My focus has primarily been on teaching software (both programming and design), networking, and cloud computing.
A summary of my teaching history is shown below.

### Course Development
Designed and implemented course materials (lab assignments and lesson plans).

* ECE361: **Computer Networks I** *(Fall '16; Summer '19 - Winter '20)*
  * Complete course re-design (syllabus, tutorials, and labs) from 2019-2020, focusing on solving fundamental networking problems from the ground up
  * Designed 7 new labs throughout the years, ranging from MAC all the way to OpenFlow
  * Created new lab environment and flexible auto-marking system
  * Set of technical demos to show in tutorials and lectures to bridge theory with reality
  * Periodic surveys to gauge students' progress, understanding, and interest
* ECE1508: **Network Softwarization: Technologies and Enablers** *(Winter '18 - '20)*
  * Aided the design of the course syllabus and the schedule of lectures, involving instructors across 4 different universities
  * Lectures pertaining to the SAVI testbed, overlay networks, NFV, SDN, and orchestration
  * Created set of hands-on labs related to each of the above topics
* ECE1548: **Advanced Network Architectures** *(Fall '12, '13, '15 - '17)*
  * Designed & implemented cloud computing labs for the SAVI testbed with topics on SDN, orchestration, monitoring, and cloud federation
* APS105: **Computer Fundamentals** *(Winter '16, '17)*
  * Designed a new computer-based examination framework as part of a trial semester
  * Designed an auto-survey system to track students' motivation and concentration

### Lecturing
Prepared lesson plans and lecture materials; delivered them in both in-person and online formats.

* ECE1508: **Network Softwarization: Technologies and Enablers** *(Winter '18 - '20)*
  * Presented lectures that streamed simultaneously to 4 universities
* **IEEE ComSoc Summer School** *(Summer '17)*
  * Created a day-long multi-session tech series on cloud computing; topics included SAVI, NFV, SDN, orchestration, monitoring, and container technologies
  * Created hands-on tutorials related to the above topics and guided students through exercises to bring theoretical concepts to reality
  * Presented set of demos to showcase Software-Defined Infrastructure

### Teaching Assistant

* ECE244: **Programming Fundamentals** *(Fall '15 - '20)*
  * Supported students in learning to program and debug C++ programs
* ECE1508: **Network Softwarization: Technologies and Enablers** *(Winter '18 - '20)*
  * Presented technical demos to showcase SAVI SDI and use of heterogeneous resources
  * Provided technical guidance and assistance to student projects
* APS105: **Computer Fundamentals** *(Fall '14, '15; Winter '16 - '20)*
  * Guided students in writing and debugging C-based programs using best practices
  * Led tutorial sessions for groups of up to 30 students, as well as 1-on-1 sessions
  * Created new lab assignments, as well as questions for midterm and final exams
* ECE297: **Communication and Design** *(Winter '14 - '20)*
  * Supervised 4 to 5 groups of students in semester-long software project
  * Advised students on best approaches for tackling certain problems
  * Evaluated code quality, technical presentations, and product pitches
* ECE361: **Computer Networks I** *(Winter '15; Fall '12, '16, '18, '19)*
  * Led weekly tutorial sessions as well as weekly TA meetings
  * Assisted students in resolving technical issues while building their networking knowledge
* ECE1548: **Advanced Network Architectures** *(Fall '12, '13, '15 - '17)*
  * Provided technical consultation for students on the design and implementation of their final projects
* ECE461: **Internetworking** *(Fall '13, '14)*
  * Guided students in configuring new networks and root-causing network-related issues
* APS106: **Fundamentals of Computer Programming** *(Winter '12)*
  * Led tutorials for groups of roughly 30 students on the C language
  * Assisted students and fellow TAs in writing and debugging code using best practices
* ECE466: **Computer Networks II** *(Winter '12)*
  * Assisted students in resolving issues with their network simulations
  * Guided students in the analysis of network data to tie theory with experimental results

### Tutoring
1-on-1 tutoring for students, identifying the specific needs and knowledge gap of the students, and preparing customized lesson plans and exercises.

* APS105: **Computer Fundamentals** *(Fall '11)*
* APS106: **Fundamentals of Computer Programming** *(Winter '12)*
