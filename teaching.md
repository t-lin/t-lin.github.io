I've served as a teaching assistant for multiple courses in roles ranging from leading tutorials, to lecturing, to designing and running hands-on labs.
I've also engaged in course design and development as well.
My focus has primarily been on teaching software (both programming and design), networking, and cloud computing.

### Course Development
Designed and implemented course materials (lab assignments and lesson plans).

* ECE361: **Computer Networks I** _(Fall '16; Summer '19 - Winter '20)_
  * Created new set of OpenFlow-based labs, creating solutions, and thoroughly testing new lab environments prior to release to students
  * Complete course re-design (syllabus, tutorials, and labs) focusing on solving fundamental problems in networking from the ground up
  * Set of technical demos to show in tutorials and lectures to bring theory to reality
  * Designed and implemented periodic questionnaires to gauge students' progress, understanding, and interest
* ECE1508: **Network Softwarization: Technologies and Enablers** _(Winter '18, '19)_
  * Created content pertaining to SAVI, overlays, NFV, SDN, and orchestration
  * Designed set of hands-on labs on SAVI related to the previous topics
* APS105: **Computer Fundamentals** _(Winter '16, '17)_
  * Designed, implemented, and trial-ran a new computer-based examination system
  * Designed and implemented a computer-based student survey system for in-lab hours

### Lecturing
Prepared lesson plans and lecture slides, and delivered them (both in-person and online formats).

* ECE1508: **Network Softwarization: Technologies and Enablers** _(Winter '18 - '20)_
* **IEEE ComSoc Summer School** _(Summer '17)_
  * Created and presented day-long series of lectures pertaining to SAVI, NFV, SDN, orchestration, monitoring, and container technology
  * Created set of hands-on tutorials on SAVI related to the above topics and guided students through exercises to bring theoretical concepts to reality
  * Presented set of demos to showcase SAVI SDI and use of heterogeneous resources

### Teaching Assistant
This role encompasses in-lab TAing (teaching students how to resolve technical issues, assessing them, and answering questions), as well as leading tutorials.

* ECE1508: **Network Softwarization: Technologies and Enablers** _(Winter '18 - '20)_
  * Created and presented lectures pertaining to SAVI, overlays, NFV, SDN, and orchestration methods
  * Presented set of demos to showcase SAVI SDI and use of heterogeneous resources
  * Provided technical advice and assistance to student projects
  * Evaluated student's project presentations and reports
* ECE244: **Programming Fundamentals** _(Fall '15 - '20)_
  * Supported students in creating and debugging C++-based object-oriented programs
  * Marked laboratory assignments, midterms, and finals
* ECE361: **Computer Networks I** _(Winter '15; Fall '12, '16, '18, '19)_
  * Led tutorial sessions and organized weekly TA meetings
  * Assisted students in resolving issues regarding labs and conducting in-lab grading
* APS105: **Computer Fundamentals** _(Fall '14, '15; Winter '16 - '20)_
  * Guided students in resolving and debugging issues regarding during lab hours
  * Led tutorial sessions for groups of up to 30 students, as well as 1-on-1 sessions
  * Created new lab assignments and created questions for midterm and finals
  * Marked assignments, quizzes, midterms, and finals
* ECE297: **Communication and Design** _(Winter '14 - '20)_
  * Supervised 4 to 5 groups of students in semester-long software project
  * Advised students on best approaches for tackling certain problems and suggested improvements on various aspects of their software
  * Marked milestones, code reviews, technical presentations, and final pitches
* ECE1548: **Advanced Network Architectures** _(Fall '12, '13, '15 - '17)_
  * Designed and implemented new cloud computing labs for the SAVI testbed, with topics on: OpenFlow, Orchestration, Monitoring, Testbed Federation
  * Consulted and aided students in overcoming various issues in their final projects
  * Extended and maintained capabilities of the SAVI network testbed upon which the student's final projects were deployed and tested on
  * Marked laboratory assignments and provided feedback on final projects
* ECE461: **Internetworking** _(Fall '13, '14)_
  * Assisted students in resolving issues regarding the labs during practical hours
  * Marked laboratory assignments
* APS106: **Fundamentals of Computer Programming** _(Winter '12)_
  * Conducted tutorials to a group of roughly 30 students
