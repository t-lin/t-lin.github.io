I dislike lazily enumerated lists of every degree ever acquired, position ever held, and skill ever learned.
***Context*** is far more insightful and interesting.
So here's a brief history of my experiences, when I learned each skill, and a few mentionable projects.  
(Alternative formats of my experience: <a href="/assets/files/cv.pdf" target="_blank">traditional CV</a> or <a href="/assets/files/resume.pdf" target="_blank">1-page resume</a>)

* 2002: Self-taught basic **HTML** and the late 90's art of making ugly sites with dumb gifs
* 2004: Learned my first programming language, **QBasic** ‚ù§  to make ASCII "videos"
* 2006-2007: First year university courses introduced me to **C++**
  * 2008: Built a **C++**-based **HTTP 1.1** web server for a course project
* 2008: Self-taught **C** for networking applications
  * Built a file copying program and an IRC-like chat application
* 2009-2010: Year-and-a-half long internship at Qualcomm Canada
  * Kernel-level development in **C** for video processing drivers
  * Created custom test case generator in **C++**
* 2010: Internetworking course introduced me to **Linux networking** and **Cisco IOS**
  * Discovered the *Holy Trinity* for debugging: tcpdump, ping, and traceroute
* 2010-2011: Self-taught basic **Objective-C** for Apple iOS app development
  * App collected and monitored vehicle telemetry via the OBD-II interface
* 2011: First foray into **Python** (no types, what?!) for summer research
  * Used to verify and build new models in an optical network simulator
* 2011: Picked up **CUDA-C** for a course project
  * Parallelized video-editing software performing high dynamic range (HDR) imaging
* 2012-<b>Present</b>: Joined the SAVI project as a developer and sysadmin
  * Self-taught **Bash scripting**  and **regex** through debugging and enhancing **OpenStack**'s horrendously long *stack.sh* script
  * Created top-level network management component, written in **Python**, that configures the underlying network via **OpenFlow**
  * Picked up **SQL**, **Git**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and manually making way too many RJ45 Ethernet cables along the way...
  * Experienced many pitfalls developing, operating and maintaining clusters of distributed servers, networks, and the software services within them. The lessons learned are

* 2013: Prototyped a system to survey users while they watch videos
  * Built a simple web app, learning **JavaScript** and **CSS** in the process
  * Used **ffmpeg** to generate and edit custom video content
* 2014: Picked up basic **Java** while debugging and fixing an Android application
* 2015: Learned **Ansible** for automating multi-server software deployments

  * Used in at least two courses to teach students **software-defined networking (SDN)**
* 2017: Self-taught **Go** to create a monitoring tool to track changes in network latency
* 2017: Supervised team of summer students to develop a framework for tracking and counting people by sniffing **Wi-Fi** frames
* 2019-2020: Developed a P2P service mesh using **Go** using libp2p
  * Managed development w/ group of students for their capstone project
* 2019-2020: Created a new lab environment & auto-marking framework in pure **Bash**
  * Enables students to work remotely, auto-updates, and remotely submit work
  * Usable for variety of courses from basic programming to networking
* 2021-2023: Developed a suite of software drivers used as part of a space access launch stack
  * Interfaced with various sensors & actuators via a variety of communication standards, including **RS-232/RS-422** UART, **CAN**, **I2C/SMBus**, as well as traditional TCP/IP
