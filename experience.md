I dislike lazily enumerated lists of every position and skill a person has ever learned (but if that's your thing, here's a [traditional CV](/assets/files/cv.pdf)).

I believe ***context*** is far more insightful and interesting.
Thus, here's a brief history of my experiences, when I learned each skill, and a few mentionable projects.
